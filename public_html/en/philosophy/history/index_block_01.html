                    <p>
                        Masayoshi Son studied at the University of California, Berkeley in the U.S. and immersed himself in various inventions and businesses. Then he decided to return to Japan to start a new business of his own.

                    <p>
                        While studying in the U.S., Masayoshi Son came across a striking picture of a microchip on a science magazine, which convinced him that the age of personal computers was coming. He moved on to launch the very first business to distribute PC software throughout Japan. He named his company SOFTBANK Corp. Japan (current SoftBank Group Corp.) ―a software bank that would serve as the infrastructure of the new information society to be built in Japan.

                    <p>
                        As PCs became more popular in Japan, SOFTBANK Corp. Japan launched Oh! PC and Oh! MZ in May 1982. Those monthly magazines targeted exclusively manufacturers and engineers, a stark contrast to the general PC magazines that were dominant in the industry at the time. The unique style of SoftBank’s magazines gained much public attention.

                        Aiming to transform into a global company, SOFTBANK Corp. Japan changed its name to SoftBank Corp. (current SoftBank Group Corp.) in July 1990. During this period, SoftBank brought new services to Japan from the U.S. As a part of it, SoftBank Holdings Inc. was established in the U.S. to identify investment opportunities in promising Internet-related companies.

                        Masayoshi Son describes the acquisition as a way to “get a map and a compass” for a voyage into the center of information technology.

                        1996 was a remarkable year for SoftBank as the company moved to launch an increasing number of several Internet-related businesses and subsidiaries.
