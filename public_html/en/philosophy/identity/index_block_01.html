                The power of intellect to discern what lies ahead one step ahead of the times and the power of execution to realize that vision are the essential qualities demonstrated by Ryoma Sakamoto, leader of Japan’s enterprising naval trading company, the Kaientai, in the 19th century. These qualities also represent the core ideals pursued by the SoftBank Group in its business activities. Using the banner of the Kaientai led by Sakamoto as a motif, the SoftBank brand logo symbolizes our passion.

                        SoftBank Group Corp. started out in 1981 as a distributor of computer software. As software is called “soft” in Japanese, the name “SoftBank” literally means “a bank of software.” We chose the word “bank” based on our grand aspiration to be a key source of infrastructure for the information society.

                                The SoftBank logo evokes the Kaientai, a modernizing and enterprising naval trading company that operated during the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan. They had an advanced information and knowledge and served as a catalyst for Japan's transformation into a modern, free-thinking, boldly decisive state, untrammeled by tribal rivalries or the conventional limits of the time.
